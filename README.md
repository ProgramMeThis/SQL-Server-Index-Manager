# SQL Server Index Manager
This application was written due to the fact that I'm needing to be able to do manage the databases that my applications utilize. In order for the databases to be as efficient as possible they need to utilize indexes. Along with that we need to make sure the indexes are maintained properly. With SQL Server there are two main options and that is to reorganize or reindex. The application allows you to specify the thresholds for when to reorganize and when to reindex and then it can go through each index and take the appropriate measures.
